# LifeFence

LifeFence is a geofencing-driven faculty attendance management system, designed to automate the attendance process using real-time location data. The project utilizes a Python FastAPI backend, a Flutter frontend, and a Supabase database, all coming together to provide a seamless solution for the HR department.

## Project Structure

- **lifefence-backend**: 
  The Python FastAPI backend responsible for handling the geofencing logic, user authentication, and API services. It integrates with the Supabase database for data storage and retrieval.
  
- **lifefence-frontend**: 
  The Flutter frontend that provides a cross-platform interface (Android, iOS, Web) for users to interact with the attendance system, view geofencing zones, and track attendance.

- **literature-review**: 
  This directory contains research materials, literature surveys, and documentation regarding geofencing technology and its applications in real-world scenarios.
